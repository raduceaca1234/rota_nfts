                  <strong>NFT stands for non-fungible tokens.</strong> Ok. Might sound weird. Leti us explain better: Goods can be fungible or non-fungible. Fungible goods can be interchanged with other goods of the same type, because fungibility implies equal value between the assets. Money is fungible. A Non-fungibility means uniqueness: it can't be replaced with something else. A non-fungible token is a piece of digital media that can be owned, sold and traded. NFTs are one of the fastest growing assets in the crypto industry. They are non-interchangeable units of data, containing a piece of identifying information that makes them distinguishable from all other tokens. Because no two tokens are the same, they cannot be traded or exchanged at an equivalent rate or broken down into smaller units like currency. So, we asked ourselves: why don’t we create charity NFTs? We are a global organization and it’s time to accept the fact that we live in a digital world as well.  Therefore, our purpose is to take things to another level. </Card.Body>

                <Card.Body> <strong>Apart from the fact that they are unique, they represent easily verifiable digital assets, meaning you are bound by a smart contract when you purchase one.</strong> The footprints of ownership are easily recognizable, thanks to blockchain. Each token is valued differently and can’t simply be replaced by another. As each NFT is unique, many people see them as valuable assets. It’s basically having something that cannot be copied: anyone can buy a Van Gogh print, but only one person can own the original. And now think about this in a digital manner. So there’s quite some hype in here with the NFTs, because owning one (or several) gets you some basic usage rights, plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up. An NFT reflects the value of the concept it represents. So just believe the hype, cause it’s real, and let’s start helping the world!</Card.Body>

                <Card.Body> <strong>Simple, but yet complex.</strong> They need to be “tokenized”. Basically, you take something that is not a token and turn it into one. Many believe that almost everything will one day be tokenized. The NFTs usually take the form of digital assets like pictures, videos, music, 3D art, poems, photography. These assets are then “minted” into tokens and stored on blockchain technology. Each token is unique and can be sold, traded, or used in other ways. It’s like buying and collecting art, and you can find different ways to use it. </Card.Body>

                <Card.Body> <strong>There are multiple NFT marketplaces to choose from if you want to sell your art online.</strong> It depends on the cryptocurrency you want to work with. Some worldwide very well-known platforms are OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare (these work on Ethereum - you must have a wallet compatible with the Ethereum network). We are working on Trust Market with Elrond. Each marketplace has a different process for minting NFTs. Anyone can create an NFT. All that’s needed is a digital wallet, a small purchase of cryptocurrency and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and turn the content into an NFT or crypto art. A crypto wallet is essential if you want to buy/sell NFTs in any NFT marketplace. The most popular crypto wallet used with OpenSea, for example, is Metamask. It is a browser plugin and it is easy to set up. You can download the wallet plugin from the Metamask website. An NFT wallet doesn't work like a physical wallet. You don't actually store NFTs or cryptocurrency in your wallet, but it provides access to the assets, which are held on the blockchain. It does so by providing a private key to that address, which allows the wallet owner to authorize transactions. If you have the private key, you effectively own anything at that address. A wallet will take care of all the technical bits for you and provide a nice user interface for buying, selling, and transferring NFTs or cryptocurrency. Moreover, it can also provide increased security with two-factor authentication, and it provides a convenient way to track your assets across devices.</Card.Body>

After naming your NFT and uploading it, scroll down and click on the create option. Your NFT will then be on the marketplace, but you still need to list it for selling. So there’s a lot going on - and that’s just the process for ONE NFT,  there’s a whole different story for a 10,000 NFTs collection - but for us it is all worth it! </Card.Body>

Everything that we will raise together out of this project will be directed to various causes that support the Ukrainians and their refugees. The situation in Ukraine and here in Romania - especially at the borders - is changing every hour and it’s clear that we are living through difficult times. But in difficult times, strong and good people must raise to empower, inspire and prove humanity and solidarity. The art of NoWar NFT is based on real life characters we have seen these days - either face to face, either on TV, either offering much-needed help, either slowly crossing the border with tears in their eyes and hope in their hearts. NoWar NFT promotes real-life heroes. The ones who are willing to go the extra mile to do good, to persevere, to succeed! </Card.Body>
